# 🌲 Random Forest Template: Ensemble Learning

## 🚀 Project Overview
**Developed a robust Python template for implementing Random Forest, a powerful ensemble learning method designed to reduce overfitting and increase predictive accuracy.**

This project aggregates hundreds of decision trees ("The Forest") to create a stable and high-performance classifier. The template automates the critical steps of ensemble modeling, including hyperparameter setup (n_estimators) and feature ranking, making it a reliable "workhorse" solution for complex tabular data.

* **Load & Prep:** Ingesting raw data and handling missing values.
* **Feature Engineering:** Separating features (X) and targets (y).
* **Data Split:** Dividing data into Training and Testing sets.
* **Modeling:** Training the algorithm on the training set.
* **Evaluation:** Testing performance on unseen data to verify accuracy.
