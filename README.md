# 🌲 Random Forest Template: Ensemble Learning

## 🚀 Project Overview
**Developed a robust Python template for implementing Random Forest, a powerful ensemble learning method designed to reduce overfitting and increase predictive accuracy.**

This project aggregates hundreds of decision trees ("The Forest") to create a stable and high-performance classifier. The template automates the critical steps of ensemble modeling, including hyperparameter setup (n_estimators) and feature ranking, making it a reliable "workhorse" solution for complex tabular data.
